Dropzone Prop Getters

 - The dropzone property getters are just two functions that return objects with propereties which you need to use to create the drag 'n' drop zone.  The root properties can be applied to whatever element you want, whereas the input properties must be applied to an <input>.

 - Note that whatever other props you want to add to the element where the props from getRootProps() are set, you should always pass them through that function rather than applying them on the element itself.  This is in order to avoid your props being overridden (or overriding the props returned by getRootProps() ). 

 Refs

 - Both getRootProps and getInputProps accept a custom refKey as one of the attributes passed down in the parameter.  

 - This can be useful when the element you're trying to apply the props from either one of those functions does not expose a reference to the element.  

 - Do not set the ref prop on the elements where getRootProps() / getInputProps() are set, instead, get the refs from the hook itself.
